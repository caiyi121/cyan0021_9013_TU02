# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
The deep cyberpunk aesthetic with vivid lighting and imaging effects in the Stray game captivated me. In particular, the neon lighting effects, the detailed urban textures, and the interactions between creatures and robots give the scenes a futuristic and life-like feel. I wanted to incorporate this cyberpunk atmosphere into my project to enhance the visual presentation and immersion. This technique is contrasting, highlights key elements of the project, fulfils the requirement for a complex visual representation in the assignment, and provides a rich and imaginative visual experience for the viewer.
